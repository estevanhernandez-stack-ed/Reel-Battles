1. Refined Scouting Reports (Draft Phase)
Since stats are hidden during the draft, your "Bio" and "Archetype" fields must hint at the underlying numbers. Based on the character evaluations:


Heart (HRT) and Clutch (CLT): Look for characters like Rocky Balboa (99 HRT, 94 CLT)  or Jimmy Chitwood (85 HRT, 99 CLT) who provide elite value in these high-weighted categories.
+1


Skill (SKL) and Athleticism (ATH): Roy Hobbs (99 SKL, 88 ATH) and Ivan Drago (85 SKL, 99 ATH) are pure powerhouses, though Drago's lower Heart (38) makes him a "glass cannon" in your weighted formula.
+1

The "Coach" Advantage: Characters like Herman Boone or Herb Brooks excel in Leadership (99 and 98 respectively), which is vital for the "Captain’s Command" synergy bonus.

2. Wildcard Mechanics (Battle Phase)
You can deepen the server-side scoring by adding a wildcardValue to the weighted score. This stat captures a character's "defining trait".
+2

Character	Wildcard Name	Category	Value	Impact
Bobby Boucher	Water Boy Rage	Mental	99	
Reflects his ability to set an NCAA record with 16 sacks in one game.

Happy Gilmore	Monster Drive	Technical	99	
Represents his uncanny ability to drive the ball hundreds of yards.

Rocky Balboa	Iron Chin	Physical	97	
Captures his superhuman ability to absorb heavy blows and keep moving forward.
+1

Dottie Hinson	The Split Catch	Technical	97	
Highlights her status as a "marvelous" on-field leader and elite catcher.
+1

Willie Beamen	Steamin'	Social	97	
Represents his rapid rise to celebrity and unique playmaking talent.
+1

3. Archetype & Synergy Updates
Ensure your "Mentor & Protege" and "Natural Chemistry" synergies are balanced against the actual stats:

Mentor & Protege (+30 pts): Pairing Mr. Miyagi (Veteran, 92 LDR) with Daniel LaRusso (Underdog, 96 HRT) perfectly mirrors your description of a Veteran guiding an Underdog.
+1


Natural Chemistry (+25 pts): A "Natural" like Apollo Creed (96 SKL)  paired with a "Teammate" like Charlie Conway (99 TMW) provides a massive boost to the Team Score because Teamwork is a high-weighted stat (1.2).

4. Advanced "Battle Insights"
For the Overview Tab, use the character evaluations to generate more descriptive insights:


The "Work Ethic" Advantage: If a team wins primarily through Heart and Leadership stats, highlight that they "out-worked" the opponent, similar to Rocky Balboa’s "hard work and perseverance".


The "Villain" Fallacy: If a player drafts a high-Intimidation team (e.g., Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago), note that they may have lost because Intimidation has the second-lowest weight (0.8) and often accompanies lower Teamwork.
